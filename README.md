## Version control
It is the process of organizing, controlling, and tracking different versions of a file. It's also known as source control or source code management. 
Purpose
## Difference between git and github
Git is a version control system that allows developers to track changes in their code. GitHub is a web-based hosting service for git repositories. In simple terms, you can use git without Github, but you cannot use GitHub without Git.
## 3 other github alternatives
1. Gitlab
2. Bitbucket
3.aws code commit
##difference between git fetch and git pull
###Git fetch
Git fetch is a command that allows you to download objects from another repository.
### Git pull
Git pull is a command that allows you to fetch from and integrate with another repository or local branch.
##Git rebase and the command
Rebasing in Git is a process of integrating a series of commits on top of another base tip. It takes all the commits of a branch and appends them to the commits of a new branch. command: git rebase <upstream-branch> Where <upstream-branch> is the branch you want to rebase onto.
## Git cherry-pick and the command
The git cherry-pick command is used in Git to apply a specific commit from one branch onto another. It allows you to take a commit (or several commits) from a different branch and apply them to your current branch, preserving the commit's changes without merging the entire branch.
command: git cherry-pick <commit-hash> Where <commit-hash> is the SHA-1 hash of the commit you want to apply to your current branch.
